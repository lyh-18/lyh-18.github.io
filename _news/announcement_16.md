We are excited to announce **Lumina-DiMOO**, our latest unified multimodal generation and understanding model built upon an advanced discrete diffusion architecture. This framework demonstrates the strong potential of multimodal diffusion large language models (dLLM) to unify diverse tasks within a single, streamlined architecture, while delivering state-of-the-art performance that surpasses many existing unified models.
