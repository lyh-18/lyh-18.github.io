Two papers were accepted by **ECCV2024**. By analyzing the relationships between image degradations, [GRIDS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12273) propose a grouped learning method to deal with multiple-degradation restoration. [X-Restormer](https://github.com/Andrew0613/X-Restormer) is a new general image restoration backbone network, which possesses good task generality and achieves competitive performance across a variety of restoration tasks.
