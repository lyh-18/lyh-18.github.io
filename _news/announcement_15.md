We introduce **ArtiMuse**, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) for professional aesthetic understanding, which is trained on **ArtiMuse-10K**, a meticulously curated, expert-annotated dataset. ArtiMuse-10K systematically defines eight explainable and fine-grained aesthetic attributes (e.g., Composition & Design, Visual Elements & Structure), with a wide coverage of diverse visual domains, including graphic design, 3D design, AIGC-generated images, photography, and painting & calligraphy.
